To complete this assignment:

    1. Open the notebooks in GitHub Codespaces or locally in GitHub Desktop. 
    2. Complete the notebook as described in the markdown cells. 
    3. The links to source the variables used in my project are cited throughout the code, although the data I use is configuered to download to any machine. 
    4. You will need a NASA EarthData login to download the SRTM elevation data. EarthData can be accessed at the following link: (https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/oauth/authorize?client_id=ZAQpxSrQNpk342OR77kisA&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/login&state=/)
    4. Once you have finished the notebook feel free to duplicate the analysis in a different location or with different climate variables.
